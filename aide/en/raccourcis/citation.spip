<!-- ig br -->   

It is often practical, in a discussion forum, to quote an excerpt from the message which we are replying to. To make the presentation of such quotes consistent, SPIP offers the shortcut
<html><tt>&lt;quote>...&lt;/quote></tt></html>.

For example:

<cadre><quote>Pretty good that SPIP.</quote>

Right you are, rubber duck :-)</cadre>

gives:

<quote><quote>Pretty good that SPIP.</quote>

Right you are, rubber duck :-)</quote>
