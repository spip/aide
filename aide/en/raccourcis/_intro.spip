{{To make the layout of the documents published by SPIP an easier task, the system offers a number of "SPIP shortcuts" which:
- simplify matters for users who do not know HTML;
- make it possible for page layout to be processed automatically.}}

So naturally you can still use HTML code in your SPIP documents, but we recommend that you opt to use these few SPIP shortcuts instead, which are much easier to remember and more especially, provide the system with some automated operations.}}
